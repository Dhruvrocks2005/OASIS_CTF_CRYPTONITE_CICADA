# Firewall Jail

Clicking prevoius and next was changing the userid parameter in the website url.
I tried exploring by entering different values in the userid parameter.
Discovered that putting the userid= -1 or 6 gave me the flag and userid=7 gives the starting page (the initial page that comes at userid-0). 

Flag:

```
OASIS{T00_m4ny_h0urs_4nd_wh3r3_d1d_1t_l34d}
```
