# Comma Separated â€¦ Virus?

Went on a wild goose chase and wasted time due to misleading description:
```
Using the basics of machine learning, perform exploratory data analysis
to try and figure out a pattern. Can you find the virus among the data?
```
Thought that we need to make a histogram in descending frequency of the values on the VAL column since `O` had the highest frequency in the column.
(I have no idea why I did that. In hindsight, it is very dumb)

Gave up performing EDA and creating a machine learning model. Tried to find clues in the excel sheet itself.

Knew that the flag would be found in the `VAL` column since it was the only one which had `{` and `}`.
Thought that the `TUNE` column had something to do with it since they both had 10000 entries while the `SCORE` column had 1048575 entries.

Sorted the excel sheet by `TUNE` in ascending order and descending order and found the flag.

Flag:
```

```
